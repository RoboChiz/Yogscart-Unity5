--== Background Notes ==--

This package contains a fictional cart racing vehicle called a monowheel.  Monowheels are a real type of vehicle; the model is not based on that episode of South Park!

The model was built with two cart racing "settings" in mind.  The first is a personal race setting where the characters are creations/avatars of my friends and myself, and the other is Yogscart, where the characters are based on members of the Yogscast.

In the Yogscart setting, this vehicle -- nicknamed Rosie -- was constructed and is driven by mad scientist Duncan Jones.


--== Sound Notes ==--

I envision this cart having a sound effect reminiscent of the Jetsons family car.  Alternately, it could sound vaguely like KITT from Knight Rider (original).  In other words, despite the exhaust pipes on the model, the cart shouldn't sound like it has an ordinary combustion engine, but rather a "futuristic" or "high tech" engine.
