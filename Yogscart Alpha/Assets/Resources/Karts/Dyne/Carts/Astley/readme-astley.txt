--== Background Notes ==--

This package contains the mesh, textures, and other data for a cart racing vehicle designed by Dyne.  The model was built with two cart racing "settings" in mind.  One is a personal race setting where the characters are creations/avatars of my friends and myself, and the other is Yogscart, a fan game where the characters are based on members of the Yogscast.

In Yogscart, this cart represents the Astley, driven by Lewis "Xephos" Brindley.  The Astley is from my Yogs Trek setting, where it is one of the shuttles carried by the U.S.S. Yogventure, a Trencher class starship commanded by Captain Xephos Raker of the Confederation of Allied Spheres Terrene.


--== Design Notes ==--

The road surface needs to be on a layer named Road, while the cart should be on a layer named Car.  The shadow and glow projectors use this layer setup.


--== Sound Notes ==--

Should sound like a spaceship.


--== To-Do ==--

- General texture improvement
- Remap control panel to its own material/texture to support animated display?
