--== Background Notes ==--

In the Yogscart setting, this vehicle -- named the Ridge Racer -- is driven by Steven "Ridgedog" Goates.  As Ridgedog is the Yogscast server admin, the cart is loosely inspired by the movie Tron.  Therefore, the vehicle encloses Ridgedog, much like Parv's coffin cart does.

The model was built with two cart racing "settings" in mind: One is a private race setting where the characters are creations/avatars of my friends and myself, and the other is Yogscart, where the characters are based on members of the Yogscast.

--== Design Notes ==--

The road surface needs to be on a layer named Road, while the cart should be on a layer named Car.  The shadow and glow projectors use these to work properly.

Please note that the Front Brake objects have an X scale of -1 to counteract the car script's behavior (it was reversing the orientation of the front tires).


--== Sound Notes ==--

I envision this cart having a very synthesized/digitized sounding engine.
